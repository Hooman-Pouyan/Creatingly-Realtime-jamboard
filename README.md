similar to other known apps with such feature such as figma jam, google docs, etc this app uses below technologies with best practises and
clean architecture to allow multiple users join a session, create a doc (we call it jam board here) and simoultinously interact with elements on the screen (add, edit, resize, drag & drop, change content, ...)

this app is developed with the best of my abilities to show how you can keep the performance and speed of the app at maximum and use real time data transmission with multiple users without sacrificing
performance:

Angular 18.1 (Latest)
NgRx Signal Store (Latest)
RxJS (90% of the app is implemented using pure reactive code with RXJS)
Nest.js
Socket.IO
Ant-Design
Tailwind
Json Server (Mock Data)
Uuid
No Real-time Libraries (i have implement every directive, and feature from scratch to make them more flexible)

THIS APP IS STILL IN DEVELOP AND IT"S ONLY A DEMO OF MY INTERVIEW PROJECT _ THE FULL APP CAN"T BE ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE OF MY COLLABORATION WITH [CREATINGLY APP](https://creatingly.com/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.
